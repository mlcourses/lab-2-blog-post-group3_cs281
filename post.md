# Lab 2: Exploring Multiplexers and Adders in Digital Circuitry

## Overview and Motivation

In this week's lab, we are going to expand the introductory circuits, which we built in the last lab, with designing two important circuits. We will design and build a multiplexer and also design an adder circuit. There are four parts to the lab:

 1. Build a 2 to 1 mux out of AND, OR and NOT gates. Test with switches.
 2. Build a 4 to 1 mux using a 74150 mux chip. Test with switches.
 3. Build a 4 to 1 mux using a 74150 mux chip. Test with Arduino program.
 4. Design and build a 1 bit adder circuit.

Through this lab's experience, we aim to deepen our understanding of digital logic and its practical applications in computing.

## Materials

The materials we will be using in this lab are:
- PB-503 breadboard
- 74150 mux (16 to 1 mux)
- Wires
- Arduino kit
- IC data sheets
- Arduino controller with the USB adapter
- computer for the Arduino IDE
- 7404 chip (NOT gate)
- 7408 chip (AND gate)
- 7432 chip (OR gate)
- 7486 chip (XOR gate)


## Project Steps

In this project, we will follow four main steps. Initially, we will set up the breadboard, connecting a wire from the +5V supply to a top column pin and another from the ground to a top pin. 

**Safety First:** Before starting each step, we will power off the breadboard for safety, then turn it on to test our setup.
